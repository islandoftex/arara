\chapter{The official rule pack}
\label{chap:theofficialrulepack}

\arara\ ships with a pack of default rules, placed inside a special subdirectory named \abox[araracolour]{rules/} inside another special directory named \abox[araracolour]{ARARA\_HOME} (the place where our tool is installed). This chapter introduces the official rules, including proper listings and descriptions of associated parameters whenever applied. Note that such rules work off the shelf, without any special installation, configuration or modification. An option marked by \rbox[araracolour]{S} after the corresponding identifier indicates a natural boolean switch. Similarly, the occurrence of an \rqbox\ mark indicates that the corresponding option is required.

\begin{messagebox}{Can my rule be distributed within the official pack?}{araracolour}{\icok}{white}
As seen in Section~\ref{sec:basicstructure}, on page~\pageref{sec:basicstructure}, the default rule path can be extended to include a list of directories in which our tool should search for rules. However, if you believe your rule is comprehensive enough and deserves to be in the official pack, please contact us! We will be more  than happy to discuss the inclusion of your rule in forthcoming updates.
\end{messagebox}

\begin{description}
\item[\rulebox{animate}]
This rule creates an animated \rbox{gif} file from the corresponding base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as a string concatenated with the \rbox{pdf} suffix, using the \rbox{convert} command line utility from the ImageMagick suite.

\begin{description}
\item[\rpbox{delay}{10}] This option regulates the number of ticks before the display of the next image sequence, acting as a pause between still frames.

\item[\rpbox{loop}{0}] This option regulates the number of repetitions for the animation. When set to zero, the animation repeats itself an infinite number of times.

\item[\rpbox{density}{300}] This option specifies the horizontal and vertical canvas resolution while rendering vector formats into a proper raster image.

\item[\rpbox{program}{convert}] This option specifies the command utility path as a means to avoid potential clashes with underlying operating system commands.

\begin{messagebox}{Microsoft Windows woes}{attentioncolour}{\icattention}{black}
\setlength{\parskip}{1em}
According to the \href{http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/windows/}{ImageMagick website}, the Windows installation routine adds the program directory to the system path, such that one can call command line tools directly from the command prompt, without providing a path name. However, \rbox{convert} is also the name of Windows system tool, located in the system directory, which converts file systems from one format to another.

The best solution to avoid possible future name conflicts, according to the ImageMagick team, is to call such command line tools by their full path in any script. Therefore, the \rbox{convert} rule provides the \abox{program} option for this specific scenario.
\end{messagebox}

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: animate: { delay: 15, density: 150 }
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{asymptote}]
This rule executes the \rbox{asy} command line program, referring to Asymptote, a powerful descriptive vector graphics language for technical drawings, inspired by Metapost but with an improved syntax. Please note that you will have to make the \rbox{.asy} extension known to \arara\ in order to compile Asymptote files. Furthermore, it is advised to use this in your regular \TeX\ document specifying the \abox{files} parameter to include all graphics you want to compile for inclusion in your document.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{color}] This option, as the name suggests, provides the underlying color model to be used in the current execution. Possible values are:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{\hphantom{x}bw\hphantom{x}}] This option value, as the name suggests, converts all colors to a black and white model.

\item[\povalue{cmyk}] This option value converts the RGB (red, green an blue) color model to the CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow and black) counterpart.

\item[\povalue{rgb}] This option value converts the CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow and black)  color model to the RGB (red, green an blue) counterpart.

\item[\povalue{gray}] This option value, as the name suggests, converts all colors to a grayscale model.
\end{description}

\item[\rpbox{engine}{latex}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to be used for the current compilation. Make sure to take a look at the Asymptote manual for further details on this option. Possible values are:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{latex}] This value, as the name suggests, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to \rbox{latex} for the current compilation. Note that the engine might play a major role in the generated code.

\item[\povalue{pdflatex}] This value, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to \rbox{pdflatex} for the current compilation. Note that the engine might play a major role in the generated code.

\item[\povalue{xelatex}] This value, as the name suggests, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to \rbox{xelatex} for the current compilation. Note that the engine might play a major role in the generated code.

\item[\povalue{lualatex}] This value, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to \rbox{lualatex} for the current compilation. Note that the engine might play a major role in the generated code.

\item[\povalue{tex}] This value, as the name suggests, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to \rbox{tex} for the current compilation. Note that the engine might play a major role in the generated code.

\item[\povalue{pdftex}] This value, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to \rbox{pdftex} for the current compilation. Note that the engine might play a major role in the generated code.

\item[\povalue{luatex}] This value, as the name suggests, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to \rbox{luatex} for the current compilation. Note that the engine might play a major role in the generated code.

\item[\povalue{context}] This value, as the name indicates, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to \rbox{context} for the current compilation. Note that the engine might play a major role in the generated code.

\item[\povalue{none}] This value, as the name suggests, sets the underlying \TeX\ engine to \rbox{none} for the current compilation. In this case, there will be no associated engine.
\end{description}

\item[\abox{format}] This option, as the name suggests, converts each output file to a specified format. Make sure to take a look at the Asymptote manual for further details.

\item[\abox{output}] This option, as the name suggests, sets an alternative output directory or file name. Make sure to take a look at the Asymptote manual for further details.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: asymptote: { files: [ mydrawing.asy ] }
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{authorindex}]
This rule calls the \rbox{authorindex} wrapper, a Perl script that processes auxiliary files generated by the package of the same name, producing author index files, with the \rbox{ain} extension.

\begin{description}
\item[\rpsbox{draft}] This option sets whether the script should write additional information to the produced file. For each author, the
labels of all references and the page numbers where they are cited are included as comments. This detail may help if you manually edit the generated author index.

\item[\rpsbox{index}] This option sets whether the script should create a file suitable for further processing with \rbox{makeindex} or
the like. For example, you could use that to make a common author and subject index. Note the extension of the generated file still will be the default one.

\item[\rpsbox{keep}] This option sets whether the script should retain the temporarily generated \rbox{bst} file after the run finishes. This information will give you a good starting point for advanced customization of the author index.

\item[\rpsbox{print}] This option, as the name indicates, sets whether the script should print the result to standard output instead of writing it to the output file.

\item[\rpsbox{recurse}] This option sets whether the script should automatically process auxiliary files produced by included files. This behaviour is enabled by default.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: authorindex: { draft: yes }
\end{codebox}



\item[\rulebox{bib2gls}]
This rule executes the \rbox{bib2gls} command line application which extracts glossary information stored in a \rbox{bib} file and converts it into glossary entry definitions in resource files. This rule passes the base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as the mandatory argument.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{dir}] This option sets the directory used for writing auxiliary files. Note that this option does not change the current working directory.

\item[\abox{trans}] This option sets the extension of the transcript file created by \rbox{bib2gls}. The value should be just the file extension without the leading dot. The default is \rbox{glg}.

\item[\abox{locale}] This option specifies the preferred language resource file. Please keep in mind that the provided value must be a valid IETF language tag. If omitted, the default is obtained by \rbox{bib2gls} from the JVM.

\item[\rpsbox{group}] This option sets whether \rbox{bib2gls} will try to determine the letter group for each entry and add it to a new field called \rbox{group} when sorting. Be mindful that some \rbox{sort} options ignore this setting. The default value is off.

\item[\rpsbox{interpret}] This option sets whether the interpreter mode of \rbox{bib2gls} is enabled. If the interpreter is on, \rbox{bib2gls} will attempt to convert any \LaTeX\ markup in the sort value to the closest matching Unicode characters. If the interpreter is off, the \rbox{log} file will not be parsed for recognised packages. The default value is on.

\item[\rpsbox{breakspace}] This option sets whether the interpreter will treat a tilde character as a non-breaking space (as with \TeX) or a normal space. The default behaviour treats it as non-breakable.

\item[\rpsbox{trimfields}] This option sets whether \rbox{bib2gls} will trim leading and trailing spaces from field values. The default behaviour does not trim spaces.

\item[\rpsbox{recordcount}] This option sets whether the record counting will be enabled. If activated, \rbox{bib2gls} will add record count fields to entries. The default behaviour is off.

\item[\rpsbox{recordcountunit}] This option sets whether \rbox{bib2gls} will add unit record count fields to entries. These fields can then be used with special commands. The default behaviour is off.

\item[\rpsbox{cite}] This option sets whether \rbox{bib2gls} will treat citation instances found in the \rbox{aux} file as though it was actually an ignored record. The default behaviour is off.

\item[\rpsbox{verbose}] This option sets whether \rbox{bib2gls} will be executed in verbose mode. When enabled, the application will write extra information to the terminal and transcript file. This option is unrelated to \arara's verbose mode. The default behaviour is off.

\item[\rpsbox{merge}] This option sets whether the program will merge \rbox{wrglossary} counter records. If disabled, one may end up with duplicate page numbers in the list of entry locations, but linking to different parts of the page. The default is on.

\item[\rpsbox{uniscript}] This option sets whether text superscript and subscript will use the corresponding Unicode characters if available. The default is on.

\item[\abox{packages}] This option instructs the interpreter to assume the packages from the provided list have been used by the document.

\item[\abox{ignore}] This option instructs \rbox{bib2gls} to skip the check for any package from the provided list when parsing the corresponding log file.

\item[\abox{custom}] This option instructs the interpreter to parse the package files from the provided list. The package files need to be quite simple.

\item[\abox{mapformats}] This option takes a list and sets up the rule of precedence for partial location matches. Each element from the provided list must be another list of exactly two entries representing a conflict resolution.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: bib2gls: { group: true }
% arara: --> if found('aux', 'glsxtr@resource')
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{biber}]
This rule runs \rbox{biber}, the backend bibliography processor for \rbox{biblatex}, on the corresponding base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as a string.

\begin{description}
\item[\rpsbox{tool}]  This option sets whether the bibliography processor should be executed in \emph{tool mode}, intended for transformations and modifications of datasources. Since this mode is oriented towards a datasource rather than a document, make sure to use it alongside the \abox{options} option.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: biber: { options: [ '--wraplines' ] }
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{bibtex}]
This rule runs the \rbox{bibtex} program, a reference management software, on the corresponding base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as a string.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: bibtex: { options: [ '-terse' ] }
% arara: --> if exists(toFile('references.bib'))
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{bibtex8}]
This rule runs \rbox{bibtex8}, an enhanced, portable C version of \rbox{bibtex}, on the corresponding base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as a string. It is important to note that this tool can read a character set file containing encoding details.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: bibtex8: { options: [ '--trace', '--huge' ] }
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{bibtexu}]
This rule runs the \rbox{bibtexu} program, an enhanced version of \rbox{bibtex} with Unicode support and language features, on the corresponding base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as a string.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: bibtexu: { options: [ '--language', 'fr' ] }
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{clean}]
This rule removes the provided file reference through the underlying system command, which can be \rbox{rm} in a Unix environment or \rbox{del} in Microsoft Windows. As a security lock, this rule will always throw an error if \mtbox{currentFile} is equal to \mtbox{getOriginalFile}, so the main file reference cannot be removed. It is highly recommended to use the special \abox{files} parameter to indicate removal candidates. Alternatively, a list of file extensions can be provided as well. Be mindful that the security lock also applies to file removals based on extensions.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{extensions}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of extensions and constructs a new list of removals commands according to the base name of the \mtbox{currentFile} reference (i.e, the name without the associated extension) as a string concatenated with each extension from the original list as suffixes. Keep in mind that, if the special \abox{files} parameter is used with this option, the resulting list will contain the cartesian product of file base names and extensions. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.

\begin{messagebox}{Better safe than sorry!}{attentioncolour}{\icattention}{black}
When in doubt, always remember that the \opbox{{-}dry-run} command line option is your friend! As seen in Section~\ref{sec:options}, on page~\pageref{sec:options}, this option makes \arara\ go through all the motions of running tasks and subtasks, but with no actual calls. It is a very useful feature for testing the sequence of removal commands without actually losing your files! Also, as good practice, always write plain, simple, understandable \rbox{clean} directives and use as many as needed in your \TeX\ documents.
\end{messagebox}
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: clean: { extensions: [ aux, log ] }
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{context}]

\item[\rpsbox{synctex}] This option sets whether \rbox{synctex}, an input and output synchronization feature that allows navigation from source to typeset material and vice versa, available in most \TeX\ engines, is activated.

\item[\abox{interaction}] This option alters the underlying engine behaviour. If this option is omitted, the engine will prompt the user for interaction in the event of an error. Possible values are, in order of increasing user interaction (courtesy of our master Enrico Gregorio):

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{batchmode}] In this mode, nothing is printed on the terminal, and errors are scrolled as if the \rbox{return} key is hit at every error. Missing files that \TeX\ tries to input or request from keyboard input cause the job to abort.

\item[\povalue{nonstopmode}] In this mode, the diagnostic message will appear on the terminal, but there is no possibility of user interaction just like in batch mode, previously described.
\end{description}

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: context
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{convert}]
This rule runs the \rbox{convert} program, a member of the ImageMagick suite of tools. This program is used to convert between image formats as well  as  resize  an  image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join, resample, and more.

\begin{description}

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{interaction}] This option alters the underlying engine behaviour. When such option is omitted, \TeX\ will prompt the user for interaction in the event of an error. Possible values are, in order of increasing user interaction (courtesy of our master Enrico Gregorio):

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{batchmode}] In this mode, nothing is printed on the terminal, and errors are scrolled as if the \rbox{return} key is hit at every error. Missing files that \TeX\ tries to input or request from keyboard input cause the job to abort.

\item[\povalue{nonstopmode}] In this mode, the diagnostic message will appear on the terminal, but there is no possibility of user interaction just like in batch mode, previously described.

\item[\povalue{scrollmode}] In this mode, as the name indicates, \TeX\ will stop only for missing files to input or if proper keyboard input is necessary. \TeX\ fixes errors itself.

\item[\povalue{errorstopmode}] In this mode, \TeX\ will stop at each error, asking for proper user intervention. This is the most user interactive mode available.
\end{description}

\item[\rpsbox{shell}] This option sets whether the possibility of running underlying system commands from within \TeX\ is activated.

\item[\rpsbox{synctex}] This option sets whether \rbox{synctex}, an input and output synchronization feature that allows navigation from source to typeset material and vice versa, available in most \TeX\ engines, is activated.

\item[\rpsbox{draft}] This option sets whether the draft mode, i.e, a mode that produces no output, so the engine can check the syntax, is activated.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: csplain: { interaction: batchmode, shell: yes }
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{datatooltk}]
This rule runs \rbox{datatooltk}, an application that creates \rbox{datatool} databases in raw format from several structured data formats, in batch mode. This rule requires \abox{output} and one of the import options.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{output}~\rqbox] This option provides the database name to be saved as output. To guard against accidentally overwriting a document file, \rbox{datatooltk} now forbids the \rbox{tex} extension for output files. This option is required.

\item[\abox{csv}] This option, as the name indicates, imports data from the \rbox{csv} file reference provided as a plain string value.

\item[\abox{sep}] This option specifies the character used to separate values in the \rbox{csv} file. Defaults to a comma.

\item[\abox{sqldb}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the name of the SQL database according to the provided value.

\item[\abox{sqluser}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the name of the SQL user according to the provided value.

\item[\rpbox{noconsole}{gui}] This action dictates the password request action if such information was not provided earlier. If there is no console available, the action is determined by the following values:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{error}] As the name indicates, this action issues an error when no password was previously provided through the proper option.

\item[\povalue{stdin}] This action requests the password via the standard input stream, which is less secure than using a console.

\item[\povalue{gui}] This action displays a dialog box in which the user can enter the password for the SQL database.
\end{description}

\item[\abox{probsoln}] This option, as the name indicates, imports data in the \rbox{probsoln} format from the file name provided as the value.

\item[\abox{input}] This option, as the name indicates, imports data in the \rbox{datatool} format from the file name provided as the value.

\item[\abox{sort}] This option, as the name indicates, sorts the database according to the column whose label is provided as the value. The value may be preceded by \rbox{+} or \rbox{-} to indicate ascending or descending order, respectively. If the sign is omitted, ascending is assumed.

\item[\abox{sortlocale}] This option, as the name indicates, sorts the database according to alphabetical order rules of the locale provided as the value. If the value is set to \rbox{none} strings are sorted according to non-locale letter order.

\item[\rpsbox{sortcase}] This option sets whether strings will be sorted using case-sensitive comparison for non-locale letter ordering. The default behaviour is case-insensitive.

\item[\abox{seed}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the random generator seed to the provided value. The seed is cleared if an empty value is provided.

\item[\rpsbox{shuffle}] This option sets whether the database will be properly shuffled. Shuffle is always performed after sort, regardless of the option order.

\item[\rpsbox{csvheader}] This option sets whether the \rbox{csv} file has a header row. The
spreadsheet import functions also use this setting.

\item[\rpsbox{debug}] This option, as the name indicates, sets whether the debug mode of \rbox{datatooltk} is activated. The debug mode is disabled by default.

\item[\rpsbox{owneronly}] This option sets whether read and write permissions when saving \rbox{dbtex} files should be defined for the owner only. This option has no effect on some operating systems.

\item[\rpsbox{maptex}] This option sets whether \TeX\ special characters will be properly mapped when importing data from \rbox{csv} files or SQL databases.

\item[\abox{xls}] This option, as the name indicates, imports data from a Microsoft Excel \rbox{xls} file reference provided as a plain string value.

\item[\abox{ods}] This option, as the name indicates, imports data from an Open Document Spreadsheet \rbox{ods} file reference provided as a plain string value.

\item[\abox{sheet}] This option specifies the sheet to select from the Excel workbook or Open Document Spreadsheet. This may either be an index or the name of the sheet.

\item[\abox{filterop}] This option specifies the logical operator to be associated with a given filter. Filtering is always performed after sorting and shuffling. Possible values are:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{or}\hfill\hphantom{w}] This value, as the name indicates, uses the logical \rbox{or} operator when filtering. This is the default behaviour. Note that this value has no effect if only one filter is supplied.

\item[\povalue{and}] This value, as the name indicates, uses the logical \rbox{and} operator when filtering. Note that this value has no effect if only one filter is supplied.
\end{description}

\item[\abox{filters}] This option takes a list and sets up a sequence of filters. Each element from the provided list must be another list of exactly three entries representing a key, an operator and a value, respectively.

\item[\abox{truncate}] This option truncates the database to the number of rows provided as the value. Truncation is always performed after any sorting, shuffling and filtering, but before column removal.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: datatooltk: {
% arara: --> output: books.dbtex,
% arara: --> csv: booklist.csv }
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{detex}]
This rule runs \rbox{detex}, a command line application that, as the name indicates, reads the provided \mtbox{currentFile} reference, removes all comments and \TeX\ control sequences and writes the remainder to the standard output or file.

\begin{description}
\item[\rpsbox{references}] This option defines whether the tool should echo values from page counters, references and citations.

The program also provides scripting capabilities, looping, functions, text processing, variables, macros, arbitrary pre-processing of input data (usually across columns), as well as the ability to perform non-linear multi-dimensional multi-set weighted data fitting.

\begin{description}
\item[\rpsbox{persist}] This option, as the name implies, sets whether the program should let plot windows survive after the main execution exits.

\item[\rpsbox{default}] this option, as the name suggests, sets whether the program should read the default settings from either \rbox{gnuplotrc} or \rbox{~/.gnuplot} on entry.

\item[\abox{commands}] This option, as the name implies, executes the requested commands before loading the next input file. Please refer to the user manual for further details.

\item[\abox{input}~\rqbox] This required option, as the name indicates, sets the list of input file names to be processed by the program. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: gnuplot: { input: [ myplot.gnuplot ], default: yes }
\end{codebox}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: halt
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{indent}]
This rule runs \rbox{latexindent}, a Perl script that indents \TeX\ files according to an indentation scheme, on the provided \mtbox{currentFile} reference.

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{default}] This value, as the name indicates, refers to the default tracing level. Note that, especially for large files, this value does affect performance of the script.

\item[\povalue{complete}] This value, as the name indicates, refers to the detailed, complete tracing level. Note that, especially for large files, performance of the script will be significantly affected when this value is used.
\end{description}

\item[\rpsbox{screenlog}] This option, as the name indicates, sets whether \rbox{latexindent} will output the log file to the screen, as well as to the specified log file.

\item[\abox{logfile}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the name of the log file generated by \rbox{latexindent} according to the provided value.

\item[\abox{output}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the name of the output file. Please note that this option has higher priority over some switches, so options like \abox{overwrite} will be ignored by the underlying script.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual script call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.

\item[\abox{settings}] This option, as the name indicates, dictates the indentation settings to be applied in the current script execution. Two possible values are available:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{local}] This value, as the name implies, acts a switch to indicate a local configuration. In this scenario, the script will look for a proper settings file in the same directory as the \mtbox{currentFile} reference and add the corresponding content to the indentation scheme. Optionally, a file location can be specified as well. Please refer to the \abox{where} option for more details on such feature.

\item[\povalue{onlydefault}] This value, as the name indicates, ignores any local configuration, so the script will resort to the default indentation behaviour.
\end{description}

\item[\abox{where}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the file location containing the indentation settings according to the provided value. This option can only be used if, and only if, \rbox[cyan]{local} is set as the value for the \abox{settings} option, otherwise the rule will throw an error.

\item[\abox{replacement}] This option, as the name indicates, implements the replacement mode switches. Three possible values are available:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{full}] This value, as the name indicates, performs indentation and replacements, not respecting verbatim code blocks.

\item[\povalue{noverb}] This value, as the name indicates, performs indentation and replacements, and will respect verbatim code blocks.

\item[\povalue{noindent}] This value, as the name implies, will not perform indentation, and will perform replacements not respecting verbatim code blocks.
\end{description}
\end{description}

\begin{codebox}{Example}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
% arara: indent: { overwrite: yes }
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{knitr}]
This rule calls the \rbox{knitr} package, a transparent engine for dynamic report generation with R. It takes an \rbox{.Rnw} file as input, extracts the R code in it according to a list of patterns, evaluates the code and writes the output in another file. It can also tangle R source code from the input document.

\begin{description}
\item[\rpbox{output}{NULL}] This option sets the output file. when absent, \rbox{knitr} will try to guess a default, which will be under the current working directory.

\item[\rpsbox{tangle}] This option sets whether to tangle the R code from the input file. Note that, when used, this option requires \abox{output} to be specified as well, otherwise an error is thrown.

\item[\rpsbox{quiet}] This option, as the name indicates, sets whether the tool should suppress both progress bar and messages.

\item[\rpbox{envir}{parent.frame()}] This option sets the environment in which code chunks are to be evaluated. Please refer to the documentation for further details.

It is very important to observe that, at the time of writing, this script is not available off the shelf in \TeX\ Live or MiK\TeX\ distributions, so a manual deployment is required. The script execution is performed by the underlying \rbox{texlua} interpreter.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{input}~\rqbox] This required option, as the name indicates, sets the input name for the song index file specified within the \TeX\ document. There is no need to provide an extension, as the value is always normalized with \mtbox{getBasename} such that only the name without the associated extension is used.

\item[\rpbox{script}{songidx.lua}] This option, as the name indicates, sets the script path. The default value is set to the script name, so either make sure \rbox{songidx.lua} is located in the same directory of your \TeX\ document or provide the correct location (preferably a full path).

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual script call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.
\end{description}

% arara: songidx: { input: songs }
\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{tex}]
This rule runs the \rbox{tex} \TeX\ engine on the provided \mtbox{currentFile} reference, generating a corresponding file in a device independent format.

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{interaction}] This option alters the underlying engine behaviour. If this option is omitted, \TeX\ will prompt the user for interaction in the event of an error. Possible values are, in order of increasing user interaction (courtesy of our master Enrico Gregorio):

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{batchmode}] In this mode, nothing is printed on the terminal, and errors are scrolled as if the \rbox{return} key is hit at every error. Missing files that \TeX\ tries to input or request from keyboard input cause the job to abort.

\item[\povalue{nonstopmode}] In this mode, the diagnostic message will appear on the terminal, but there is no possibility of user interaction just like in batch mode, previously described.

\item[\povalue{scrollmode}] In this mode, as the name indicates, \TeX\ will stop only for missing files to input or if proper keyboard input is necessary. \TeX\ fixes errors itself.

\item[\povalue{errorstopmode}] In this mode, \TeX\ will stop at each error, asking for proper user intervention. This is the most user interactive mode available.
\end{description}

\item[\rpsbox{shell}] This option sets whether the possibility of running underlying system commands from within \TeX\ is activated.

\item[\abox{options}] This option, as the name indicates, takes a list of raw command line options and appends it to the actual system call. An error is thrown if any data structure other than a proper list is provided as the value.

\end{codebox}

\item[\rulebox{texcount}]
This rule runs \rbox{texcount}, a Perl script designed to count words in \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ files, ignoring macros, tables, formulae and more on the provided \mtbox{currentFile} reference. The script is highly configurable, so make sure to check the manual for further information. 

\begin{description}
\item[\abox{rules}] This option, as the name suggests, sets the rules which dictate how the script should work regarding word counting and option handling. Possible values are:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{relaxed}] This value, as the name indicates, sets a relaxed set of rules, allowing more general cases to be counted as either words and macros.

\item[\povalue{restricted}] This value, as the name indicates, sets a more restricted set of rules for word counting and option handling.
\end{description}

\item[\abox{verbosity}] This option, as the name suggests, sets the verbosity level of the script according to the provided integer value. Possible values are:

\begin{description}
\item[\povalue{\hphantom{x}0\hphantom{x}}] This value sets the lowest verbosity level of all, such that the script does not present parsing details.

\item[\povalue{\hphantom{x}1\hphantom{x}}] This value raises the details a bit and sets the verbosity level to include parsed words and marked formulae.

\item[\povalue{\hphantom{x}2\hphantom{x}}] This value adds more details from the previous verbosity level by including ignored text as well.

\item[\povalue{\hphantom{x}3\hphantom{x}}] This value adds more details from the previous verbosity level by including comments and options.

\item[\povalue{\hphantom{x}4\hphantom{x}}] This value sets the highest verbosity level of all, such that the script includes parsed worded, marked formulae, ignored text, comments, options and internal states.

It is highly advisable to browse the relevant documentation about packages and tools described in this chapter as a means to learn more about features and corresponding advanced usage. For \TeX\ Live users, we recommend the use of \rbox{texdoc}, a command line program to find and view documentation. For example, this manual can be viewed through the following command:

\begin{codebox}{Terminal}{teal}{\icnote}{white}
$ texdoc arara
\end{codebox}

The primary function of the handy \rbox{texdoc} tool is to locate relevant documentation for a given keyword (typically, a package name) on your disk, and open it in an appropriate viewer. For MiK\TeX\ users, the distribution provides a similar tool named \rbox{mthelp} to find and view documentation. Make sure to use these tools whenever needed!
