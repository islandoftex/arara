# Error_FileDoesNotExistWithExtensionsList = I''m sorry, but the file ''{0} {1}'' does not exist. Note that when you provide only the basename (i.e, the filename without the extension) or with an unknown extension, arara will try to look for files ending with the predefined extensions {1} in that order. You can override the order, the search pattern or even add support for new extensions through the configuration file. Please refer to the arara manual to learn more about this feature.

# Error_FileDoesNotExist = File ''{0}'' does not exist.

# Error_InvalidYAMLConfigurationFile = I'm sorry, but apparently your arara configuration file is invalid, that is, it has invalid or missing YAML entries. Unfortunately, arara cannot proceed until the error is fixed. I tried my best to dump the error message, so here it is:

# Error_InvalidConfigurationFile = Uh-oh, the configuration file appears to be invalid. Are you sure it's a proper YAML file? Unfortunately, arara cannot proceed until a proper configuration file is provided.

# Error_InvalidLanguageConfigurationFile = Houston, we have a problem. Sadly, the language set in the configuration file is not valid. Currently, arara can provide support for the following languages: {0}. Make sure to choose a valid language or remove the entry from the configuration file (the field is optional), otherwise arara cannot proceed.

# Error_InvalidFiletypesConfigurationFile = I'm sorry, but it seems your configuration file has customized filetypes with neither the extension or pattern defined. Both are required in order to continue. Please fix this error in your configuration file and try again.

# Error_PathRuntimeErrorConfigurationFile = I''m sorry, but one of the entries of the search path in your configuration file has an unavailable variable in the path context: ''{0}''

# Error_PathIOErrorConfigurationFile = I'm sorry, but one of the entries of the search path in your configuration file has a malformed directory structure. Could you take a look at it?

# Error_InvalidYAMLDirective = It appears there is a malformed directive found at line {0}, that is, a directive that might have a YAML syntax error or an invalid field. I tried my best to dump the error message, so here it is:
Error_InvalidYAMLDirective = 

# Error_DirectiveEmptyCurlyBrackets = Directive ''{0}'' at line {1} has empty curly brackets. Note that arara opts for a cleaner syntax when a directive has no parameters. To fix it, it''s enough to either remove the curly brackets or provide the arguments for the directive.
Error_DirectiveEmptyCurlyBrackets = 

# Error_DirectiveInvalidArgumentList = Directive ''{0}'' at line {1} has an invalid argument type. The argument ''{2}'' is a reserved arara keyword and always requires a list.

# Error_DirectiveReservedKeyword = Directive ''{0}'' at line {1} has an invalid argument name. The name ''{2}'' is a reserved arara keyword representing every element in the ''{3}'' list. Please, pick another name for that argument.

# Error_DirectiveListError = Directive ''{0}'' at line {1} has an invalid argument type. Only the arguments ''files'' and ''items'' can have a list. Both are reserved arara keywords.

# Error_InvalidDirective = Apparently, there''s an invalid directive at line {0}. Please take a look and fix it.

# Error_InvalidLanguage = I'm sorry, but the language code you chose is invalid. Currently, the following languages are supported:

# Error_RuleNotFound = Uh-oh, I could not find the ''{0}'' rule in the search path. Could you take a look if the rule name is correct and if the rule is accessible through the search path?
Error_RuleNotFound = 

# Error_InvalidYAMLRule = It appears that the ''{0}'' task has a YAML syntax error or an invalid field. Could you take a look at the ''{0}.yaml'' file located at ''{1}''. I tried my best to dump the error message, so here it is:

# Error_ForbiddenIdentifierRule = Uh-oh, the ''{0}'' task (referencing the ''{0}.yaml'' file located at ''{1}'') has an invalid argument identifier. ''{2}'' is a reserved keyword, so it cannot be used. Could you use another name?
Error_ForbiddenIdentifierRule = 

# Error_EmptyArgumentsListRule = A problem was detected in the ''{0}'' task. The ''{0}.yaml'' file located at ''{1}'' requires a valid list of arguments. Could you fix it? Note that the list of arguments can also be empty, but it is still necessary to define it explicitly (with ''arguments: []'').
Error_EmptyArgumentsListRule = 

# Error_WrongIdentifierRule = Uh-oh, the ''{0}'' task (referencing the ''{0}.yaml'' file located at ''{1}'') has the wrong identifier - ''{0}'' was expected, rather than ''{2}''. Could you fix it?
Error_WrongIdentifierRule = 

# Error_ArgumentsNotDefinedInRule = Oh no, there are arguments used in the diretive ''{0}'' which are not defined in the ''{0}.yaml'' rule located at ''{1}''. You can either remove them from the ''{0}'' directive or add them to the list of arguments in the ''{0}.yaml'' rule. Here they are: {2}
Error_ArgumentsNotDefinedInRule = 

# Error_DefaultValueRuntimeErrorRule = I''m sorry, but the default value set for the argument ''{0}'' of the ''{1}'' task (referencing the ''{1}.yaml'' file located at ''{2}'') has an unavailable variable/method in the rule context: ''{3}''
Error_DefaultValueRuntimeErrorRule = 

# Error_FlagRuntimeErrorRule = I''m sorry, but the flag set for the argument ''{0}'' of the ''{1}'' task (referencing the ''{1}.yaml'' file located at ''{2}'') has an unavailable variable/method in the rule context: ''{3}''
Error_FlagRuntimeErrorRule = 

# Error_DuplicatedCommandElementsRule = Uh-oh, both ''command'' and ''commands'' fields are set in the ''{0}'' task (referencing the ''{0}.yaml'' file located at ''{1}''). You need to pick only one of them. If your task only relies on a single command, you can opt for ''command''; if your rule requires a set of commands, maybe the ''commands'' field is more suitable.
Error_DuplicatedCommandElementsRule = 

# Error_MissingCommandElementsRule = Uh-oh, the ''{0}'' task (referencing the ''{0}.yaml'' file located at ''{1}'') does not have either the ''command'' or ''commands'' elements. You need to pick only one of them. If your task only relies on a single command, you can opt for ''command''; if your rule requires a set of commands, maybe the ''commands'' field is more suitable.
Error_MissingCommandElementsRule = 

# Error_CommandRuntimeErrorRule = I''m sorry, but the command set for the ''{0}'' task (referencing the ''{0}.yaml'' file located at ''{1}'') has an unavailable variable/method in the rule context: ''{2}''
